Build wireless two-node net, ESP32.  In Forth,  under Arduino ;)

#### 1. Find equipment

    *You're smart .. you make things go.*

 * Router, power supply, network cable (straight, not crossover)
 * spare host PC (Debian Bullseye, recently updated)
 * reverse engineer router access using second host PC (don't need it to connect elsewhere)
   * boot second PC on regular LAN subnet and install `nmap` (wild guess here as to its usefulness but it's not installed already)

#### 2. Done deal - was too easy to describe here (atm) ;)

END.
